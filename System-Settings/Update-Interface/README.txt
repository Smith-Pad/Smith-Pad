                                        This script allows the ability to update the Smith-Pad Interface 
                                        using the git pull in the backend. Essentially, the user has
                                        to press a button, and then in the backend, it makes use of the 
                                        [git pull] command. 
  
  
                                        The second process, after that, it makes use of the refresh syntax
                                        in HTML to go to the splashscreen, informing the user that the 
                                        process has been completed. This is followed by this file:

# Package Management Scripts

### What is this?

> Bunch of Package Management Scripts that are used as a backend for Smith-Pad-OS-Shell



### Why UX is so important in Linux in general? 

> UX is important. Even if using the terminal to manage a system is advised, 
> consider the System Administrator's or the user's viewpoint. Few users and 
> system administrators are unfamiliar with Linux commands. UX steps in to help 
> with this challenge.


> Even though there are frontends to solve this problem, but it doesn't really
> solve the problem completely. With Smith-Pad-OS-Shell and FOIL-UI, UX design 
> should be optimized for more accessbility for all users.

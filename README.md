# Subjects-Testing

> Subjects is a component of the Smith-Pad Web-Interface that allows students 
> to learn Math, Reading, Science, and other subjects in a fun and tactful way, 
> even when they are not connected to the internet.


> The new Subjects Web Interface is being tested and developed on this specific 
> branch to see how it works with the Smith-Pad Web Interface.


> NOTE: This branch will be deleted when it is finally merged to other branches
